```{R}
rm(list = ls(all = TRUE))
# dsetwd("fill in here") # the location of your MR files
# setwd("//Users//cms1//Desktop//MRSLIDES2020//") # all my files for MR are here
# read the snp to exposure file

# calculate F-statistic for each SNP

Fcalc_tbw$f1 %>% 
  mean

Fcalc_tbw %>% 
  select(SNP, f1) %>% 
  filter(f1 < 10)
```

* Did any of the SNPs have F-statistic <10?
  * No SNPS
* What would you do if the standard error for SNP on exposure was missing?
  * Remove or impute the SNPs
  
# 2. Is the instrument for iron associated with potential confounders?
```{R}
vtas %>% 
  select(SNP, eaf, beta, se, other_allele, effect_allele) %>% 
  write_csv("Lab2/MRBase.csv")
```

* Was iron associated with any of these potential confounders?
  * No
* What would you if iron was associated with these potential confounders?
  * Change the IV
*	Were all the SNPs available in UKBiobank?
  * Yes, they are avaialble.
* What should you do for the unavailable SNPs?
  * Use different database.

# 3. Is the instrument for iron associated with survival?
* Was iron associated with parental attained age?
  * No
* What would you if iron was associated with parental attained age?
  * Consider selection biases
*	Were all the SNPs available in UKBiobank?
  * Yes
* What should you do for the unavailable SNPs?
  * Remove or impute the SNPs
  
```{R}
vtas$SNP %>% 
  cat(., sep = ", ")
